Air pollution is a significant global challenge that requires collective efforts from individuals, communities, governments, and industries to address. By taking steps to reduce our contribution to air pollution and advocating for policies and practices that promote cleaner air, we can help protect the environment and safeguard our health for generations to come. 
In a time of information saturation and global climate crisis, there is a need for distributed accessible high-quality information. This combined with the increasing propensity for the individual to find their own specific information sources tailored to their own needs means that tools are needed which allow individuals to cross-reference the information they receive using reliable and objective sources. 
The application to be developed, therefore, aims to be a tool that provides easy access to air quality data in order to empower them both in their personal lives and as members of a community. The application is not a source in and of itself, but rather a visualization tool for existing and established data sources.
